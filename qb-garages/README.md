‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Basic Configuration Options


```lua
 Config = {
    UseTarget = false,                 -- Use qb-target instead of DrawText3D
    VehicleSpawnDistance = 5.0,        -- Distance to spawn vehicles from the garage point

    ImpoundFee = 500                   -- Base fee for impound retrieval
}
```
Adding New Garages
To add a new garage, add a new entry to the Config.Garages table in config.lua:

```lua
Config.Garages = {
    yourgarage = {
        label = 'Your New Garage',
        coords = vector4(215.9, -810.65, 30.73, 339.54),
        type = 'public',
        spawnPoints = {
            vector4(222.89, -804.16, 30.15, 248.0),
            vector4(224.51, -798.82, 30.15, 248.0)
        },
        transferSpawn = vector4(195.4, -825.3, 30.2, 340.0),
        transferArrival = vector4(213.2, -799.8, 30.1, 250.0),
        transferExit = vector4(178.5, -833.6, 30.8, 160.0)
    }
}
```

Adding Job Vehicles`
To add vehicles to job garages, edit the Config.JobGarages table:

        coords = vector4(454.6, -1017.4, 28.4, 90.0),
        type = 'job',
        job = 'police',
        spawnPoint = vector4(438.4, -1018.3, 27.7, 90.0),
        vehicles = {
            newvehicle = {
                label = 'New Police Vehicle',
                model = 'policeb',
                icon = 'üèçÔ∏è'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Blip Settings
Garage blip settings can be configured inside:

```lua

    Enable = true,
    Sprite = 357,
    Color = 3,
    Scale = 0.7,
    Display = 4,
    ShortRange = true
}
```

### Step 2: Database Setup

## üîç JSON Editing Tips

When editing the config.json file:

1. Always use **double quotes** for keys and string values
2. Do not leave trailing commas after the last item in arrays or objects
3. Validate your JSON using a tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)
4. Coordinates must follow the format: `{"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "z": 0.0, "w": 0.0}`
5. Save the file in UTF-8 encoding

## üéÆ In-Game Usage

- Access job-specific vehicles from your job's garage
- Job vehicles are automatically available based on your job

### Gang Garages
- Share vehicles with your gang members

### Shared Garages
- Create a shared garage from the garage interface
- Share the access code with friends to give them access
- Manage members through the interface

### Impound

- Players must pay the fee to recover their impounded vehicles

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Config not loaded" error
- Verify that config.json exists and is correctly formatted
- Check for JSON syntax errors using a validator

### Vehicles not appearing
- Ensure your database is properly set up with the SQL file
- Check if the player owns the vehicles
- Verify garage coordinates are correct

### Permissions issues
- Check job/gang configurations match your server's job/gang names
- Verify that players have the correct permissions
