## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

This version of `ox_inventory` has been modified to improve compatibility with the latest versions of **qb-core**. It began as a continuation of an older fork which originally reintroduced QB compatibility but is no longer available. Since then, this fork has evolved into a community-focused version aimed at ensuring broad compatibility while introducing small, non-intrusive quality-of-life enhancements.

**Important:**
The original `ox_inventory` was developed by the **Overextended** team, but is no longer actively maintained by them and remains under its original license.
This modified version is **not officially supported by the Overextended team**.
Please do **not contact them** for issues related to this fork.

---

### Purpose

This fork exists to provide a more collaborative and inclusive solution for the FiveM community. We believe in open-source software that evolves with the input of its users, encouraging innovation and adaptation through collective development.

## Key Differences from Other Forks

### Rarity Indicators (Optional Visual Feature)

* Items can now display colored borders and glow effects based on a `"rarity"` metadata key.
* Supported values: `common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, `epic`, `legendary`, `artifact`, `red`, `pink`, `gold`.

### Modern QB-Core Compatibility Restored

* Fully re-integrated with the latest versions of **qb-core**.
* Preserves full support for **ESX**, **ox\_core**, **QBox**, and **ND\_Core** ‚Äî no features are lost for users of these frameworks.

### Additional Image Extensions Supported

* Out-of-the-box support for `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.gif` image formats.
* No need for manual configuration to use these file types.

### More Image Hosting Sources Allowed

* Now supports image links from additional domains like **img.bb** and **Discord CDN**.

## Wrapper exports

To simplify cross-resource integrations, `ox_inventory` provides generic server exports
that automatically call the appropriate inventory system based on `shared.framework`.
Scripts should prefer these helpers over directly invoking a specific inventory API.

```lua
-- open a stash for a player
exports.ox_inventory:OpenStash(source, 'mystash')

-- open a registered shop
exports.ox_inventory:OpenShop(source, 'twentyfourseven')
```
